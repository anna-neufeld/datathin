Before using this tutorial, we recommend that you read through our [introductory tutorial](https://anna-neufeld.github.io/countsplit/articles/countsplit_tutorial.html) to understand our method in a simple example with simulated data. 


# Naive method doesn't work. 

Anna is going to add this using demos from group meeting slides. 

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
X <- rnorm(1000)
print(X[12])
```


# Splitting the data

Anna is going to add this too.

```{r}
library()
```


# Determining number of clusters


# Using cross validation!!!
