What is datathin?
-----

The ``datathin`` R package splits a random variable (or a vector or matrix of random variables) into an independent training set and a test set using the methodology introduced in Neufeld et al., 2023 [(link to preprint coming soon)](...). 

How can I get datathin?
-----

Make sure that ``remotes`` is installed by running ``install.packages("remotes")``, then type

```{r}
remotes::install_github("anna-neufeld/datathin")
```

Where can I learn more? 
-----

For how, you can check our our [introductory tutorial](), which gives extremely basic examples of how to use our package. More tutorials for this package are coming soon! We will provide examples of how to use ``datathin`` for tasks such as model evaluation and inference after model selection under a variety of distributional assumptions. 

We will also soon post a link to our preprint where you can learn more!

To reproduce the figures from our preprint, please see the following repository: [https://github.com/anna-neufeld/datathin_paper](https://github.com/anna-neufeld/datathin_paper).
